# Research Paper Insights Generator

## Overview
This project provides a system to retrieve and analyze research papers effectively. By allowing users to input the URL of a research paper, the application scrapes its content, processes it into embeddings, and generates precise, context-aware responses to user queries using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The output is displayed in a chat interface for seamless user interaction.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: Extract textual content from research paper URLs using Beautiful Soup.
- **Vector Embedding Generation**: Represent research content in high-dimensional vectors.
- **FAISS for Similarity Search**: Perform efficient in-memory searches for relevant content.
- **Speculative RAG Model**: Utilize a dual-model architecture for response generation:
  - A specialized model drafts responses.
  - A generalized model refines and verifies them.
- **Flask Integration**: Provide an intuitive chat-based interface for query-response interaction.
- **Supported Websites**: Arxiv, ScienceDirect, Iee
